            <h1 class="margin text-center">The Dreamer Project</h1>
            <p>Context: for this project, me and my partner: Sammy was made a movie website using the skill we have so far! </p>
            <p>Content: This is the first project that was assigned to us from Mr. Muller. We had to work with the person we sat next to us,and my parnter and I decided to make a movie about the genre we picked: Comdey and Horror.</p>
            <p>The movie we wrote is about an alligator aka his name is called "The Gaterman", he woke up in the morning and go to his company "The Dreamer" but when he wanted to go to his company he kept triping and was send to the hostipal, but he was in a coma, which he was stuck in a dream of his worst nighmare. Which it kinda ended with a cliff hanger.</p>
            <p>We accomplished creating this project by using h1 and paragraph (p) elements, divs, spans, importing google fonts, inputs and submits, elements, class, id, padding, border, and margin. Sammy made the logo from `logo maker` to make the image of "The Gaterman" we both worked on this project for 4 days including working at home and at class. But my partner is satifasted with the finishing product. (it looks decent but not the worse)</p>
            <p>Challenges: While making this movie webpage some challenges that I faced with my partner, is the role that we had to pick because I didn't know my partner that well, that I don't know what good at with their coding. Which made me don't know how to spilt the work evenly with my partner. Another challanges I had is when er had to the font. It was challenging for me because I had to do trails and error for the fonts, but it works eventually after some trails and error with the fonts. The third challanges I faces is when my partner needed helped with a code, but I didn't want to give away the answers because she had to learn it herself. Which also makes it difficult for me because I'm multitasking on what I'm focusing on and trying to help her at the same time.</p>
            <p>Something that I learnt while working on my project, is that I understand more of the CSS coding and the HtML than I used to because I know how to use `class` and `id` correctly and when to use it. Another thing that I also learnt while making this project is that when I need help I use `www.w3schools.com` because it helps me understand how to use my codes correctly. Which it helps know what I did wrong with my codes and what I needed to add.</p>
            <p>If I had more time on with this project, the next step that I would do is to try to learn more advance code that I had never learnt before and try to imply it to my project or any of my future projects with my partner.</p>
